This will depend on the specific meal being prepared, but a general example includes:\n\n* Planning:\n    * Sub-task 1: Determine the meal (recipe selection, considering dietary needs and available ingredients).\n    * Sub-task 2: Check pantry and refrigerator for existing ingredients.\n    * Sub-task 3: Create a shopping list (if necessary).\n    * Sub-task 4:  Plan cooking timeline\/schedule.\n\n* Preparation:\n    * Sub-task 5:  Gather all necessary ingredients and equipment.\n    * Sub-task 6: Wash and prepare vegetables\/fruits (chop, peel, etc.).\n    * Sub-task 7: Measure out ingredients.\n    * Sub-task 8:  Prepare meat\/protein (marinate, etc.).\n\n* Cooking:\n    * Sub-task 9: Cook the meal according to the recipe.\n    * Sub-task 10: Monitor cooking process (adjust heat, stir, etc.).\n\n* Cleanup:\n    * Sub-task 11: Wash dishes and clean cooking area.\n    * Sub-task 12: Put away leftovers (if any).\n\n\nII.
